        the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
        the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
        changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
        menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
